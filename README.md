# Framer Motion - useInView

Example of using `useInView` from `framer-motion` to animate elements when they come into view.

When 50% of the element is in view, the `useInView` hook will trigger the `ref` and `inView` properties.

This example also demonstrates how to handle a text animation using `AnimatePresence` and `motion` components.

## Usage

```bash
$ pnpm install

$ pnpm run dev
```
